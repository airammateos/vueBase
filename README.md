# Vue3 "vitaminized"
The idea is to have a **"vitaminized"** [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) base project for not wasting time configuring it and dedicating the time to what is needed: **creating content**.

Built using [Vue Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) it has the following installed packages and plugins:
- [TypeScript](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/typescript-support.html#official-declaration-in-npm-packages)
- [Vue Router](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#vue-router)

Sure we can add something to make this "base project" powerfull. Contributions are welcome!
